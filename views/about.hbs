        Who’s Hatice Erdogan

        <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">
          Introduction
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Driven by a passion for art and years of experience, Hatice brought her dream of creating Heart Pottery Studio to life. 
          She views art as both a means of expression and a unifying force. As an artist and instructor working primarily with ceramics, 
          she aims to make the creative process accessible to everyone.

          Development
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Hatice's artistic journey began 14 years ago when she entered Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University in Turkey. 
          There, she adopted a multidisciplinary approach to art and found her personal expression through clay. 
          After moving to Canada, she began working in ceramics, and her ceramic sculptures have been exhibited at the Gardiner Museum. 
          She has also participated in many other art projects, including DesignTO, BigArtTO, and several other art organizations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Hatice describes pottery as "almost like meditation." She says, "Clay, being a natural material from the earth, 
          takes away our negative energies and relaxes us mentally. You don't think about anything else while making pottery." 
          In her teaching philosophy, she believes that everyone has their own unique way of learning and that the process of teaching 
          and learning requires a great deal of patience. Playing with clay, she emphasizes, is an incredibly helpful and educational 
          experience in developing patience.

          Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Hatice continues to create an inspiring, supportive, and community-driven environment at Heart Pottery. 
          She brings the same excitement to her students as they experience art for the first time, fostering a love for creativity. 
          For Hatice, being a part of the artistic journey and witnessing the excitement of learning is always a rewarding experience.
