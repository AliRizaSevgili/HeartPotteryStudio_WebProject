      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        At Heart Pottery, we want to ensure all our students have fair access to limited class spots. 
        When you select a slot, we temporarily hold it for you, preventing others from booking the same spot.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-600">
        To prevent slots from being held indefinitely, we release them after 15 minutes of inactivity. 
        This helps ensure that slots don't remain unavailable if someone changes their mind or forgets to complete their booking.
